Profitability Analysis is done for showing the profits gained as because in previous files only revenue generated is shown. For this new pivot table is generated with Cost, Revenue, Profit and Profit Margin.

Profit Margin can't be added to the pivot table directly by creating Profit margin column in table as it will give you sum of margin and will exceed above than 1000% and is not correct. So we directly add Margin through `Fields, Items & Sets` present in `PivotTable Analyze` tab.
