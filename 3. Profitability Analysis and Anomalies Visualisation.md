The coloured bars are added with the help of conditional formatting for better comparision of data in respective columns.

Profit Margin can't be added to the pivot table directly by creating Profit margin column in table as it will give you sum of margin and will exceed above than 1000% and is not correct. So we directly add Margin through `Fields, Items & Sets` present in `PivotTable Analyze` tab.

Now the Profit Margin added is correct.
