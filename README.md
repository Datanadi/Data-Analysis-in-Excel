# Sales Data Analysis and Visualization

## Introduction
The aim of the sales data analysis is to uncover invaluable information that can help us decide whether to adjust prices or increase or decrease supply of products on the basis of various factors.

If a particular product’s sales are lagging, consider seasonal fluctuations or alternative products being offered by a competitor at a discounted price. You may need to reposition products or target a specific customer demographic.

If you do a sales analysis and look at the products that are not selling, that doesn’t mean that you get rid of them. It may also tell us to correct something, such as ineffective marketing tactics, to get the sales you need.
